# Function that counts alarm and alarm rate. It uses splines fitted to the means
# of quantiles and is therefore sensitive to the knots, due to the decreased sample size.
# Input: takes a training and test set of load and vibrations, vector of knots, 
# number of bins and the minimum load included in the calculations. 
# So far it is still neccessary to define the knots manually.
# output: count of alarms and alarm rate, and a plot of log of the vibrations 
# against load, splines fitted to the means and 3 standard diviations above and 
# below the means and alarms in the test set is plotted.
