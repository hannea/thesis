# Function that counts alarm and alarm rate. It uses splines fitted to the 
# training data.
# Input: takes a training and test set of load and vibrations, vector of knots, 
# and the minimum load included in the caculations. 
# So far it is still neccessary to define the knots manually.
# output: count of alarms and alarm rate, and a plot of log of the vibrations 
# against load, splines fitted the training data and 3 standard diviations 
# above and  below the spline and alarms in the test set is plotted.
