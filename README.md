# thesis_scripts
Repository with a small selection of the R scripts used in my thesis. The most important R scripts are found in the folder called "models". These scripts uses the functions implemented in the R package ´monitor´, which can be downloaded on https://github.com/hannea/monitor.

### Three folders:
* **initial**: Initial data analysis and data testing scripts
* **knitr**: Rnw files used to generate pdfs using the knitr package
* **models**: Models and model evaluation scripts

All script names start with the creation date of the script.
